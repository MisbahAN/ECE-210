# ECE 210 - Introduction to Digital Logic Design Lab Repository

## Overview
This repository contains lab manuals and completed lab reports for my ECE 210 - Introduction to Digital Logic Design course at the University of Alberta. Through these labs, I explore combinational and sequential logic design, Boolean algebra, and circuit minimization, using tools like Xilinx Vivado for implementation on FPGA hardware.

### Course Information
- **Course Code:** ECE 210
- **Credits:** 3 units (fi 8)(EITHER, 3-0-3/2)
- **Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta
- **Additional Fees:** Instructional support fees apply

### Topics Covered
- Boolean algebra, truth tables, Karnaugh maps
- Basic gates and symbols: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR
- Number systems and codes
